{"body":"Vivente - Conway's Game of Life\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt of implementation of the famous Conway's game of life.  \r\nAt the moment it is really simple because I started studying Common Lisp recently, and I wrote this program in order to improve my programming skills.  \r\n\r\nUse\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to try it you should load the file and call the function 'run'.  \r\nHere are some examples of use:  \r\n\r\n> (run)            ;; run the evolution of a world of predefined size  \r\n> (run '(100 100)) ;; run the evolution of a 100x100 world  \r\n\r\nIn the case that you want to see the evolution to proceed slowly, you can\r\nmodify the update interval by changing the value of the respective parameter.  \r\nFor changing the size of the world, instead, you should modify the \r\n*default-world-size* parameter or call the 'run' function with a list of two\r\nitems as argoument, each representing the width and the height respectively.  \r\nAn example of the latest use can be seen in the examples presented over here.  \r\n\r\nParameters\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe parameters that can be easily modified in the source are the following:  \r\n* size of the world  \r\n* update interval between each generation  \r\n* size of the window\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n* asdf  \r\n* cl-opengl  \r\n* cl-glut  \r\n* cl-glu  \r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
